# ZeroNet Site Template - Mithril

This is an evolution of my [previous ZeroNet site
template](https://github.com/anoadragon453/ZeroNetTemplate) that featured
Vue.js, this time using Mithril.js. It also comes with a much cleaner codebase
and (soon) much documentation on how to set everything up if you're just a
beginner to ZeroNet in general.

Includes a custom RouteResolver to work with Mithril's in-built routing to
support ZeroNet's iframe setup. TODO: Section about how this works in detail.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
